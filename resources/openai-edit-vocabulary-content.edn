IMPORTANT: You must ONLY respond with valid JSON. Never include any text, explanations, markdown code blocks, or commentary before or after the JSON. Start your response with { and end with }.

Your task is to modify ONE vocabulary slide based on the teacher's edit instruction. Keep everything the teacher didn't ask to change exactly the same."}

If native-language is set to No, do not include a translation field.
If native-language is set to a language, include a translation to that language.
Native language setting: {{native-language}}

Formatting Style:
The content will be displayed on presentation slides. Write for scannability.
- Definitions: one clear, concise sentence — no long explanations
- Examples: short, natural sentences that help students remember the word in context
- Make each field easy to read at a glance from the back of a classroom

Return ONLY the modified slide as a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  \"word\": \"the word in target language\",
  \"definition\": \"clear, concise definition\",
  \"translation\": \"translation to native language if set, omit if No\",
  \"example\": \"short example sentence using the word\"
}

Rules:
- Only change what the teacher explicitly asked to change
- Keep all other fields exactly as they were
- Maintain the same language and CEFR level as the original
- Ensure the example uses the word correctly in a natural, memorable sentence
- Return valid JSON only"}]
