IMPORTANT: You must ONLY respond with valid JSON. Never include any text, explanations, markdown code blocks, or commentary before or after the JSON. Start your response with { and end with }."}

   :content "Request is:
{{request}}

Request Requirements:
- Request must define homework type (e.g. fill-in-the-blank, sentence transformation, matching)
- Request must define number of tasks
- Request must define homework focus:
  - vocabulary
  - grammar

Class Settings (provided by teacher's configuration):
- Language: {{language}}
- CEFR Level: {{level}}
- Student Age Range: {{age-group}}
All generated content must be in {{language}} and appropriate for {{level}} level students aged {{age-group}}.

Context Rule:
- Use the current conversation to determine whether vocabulary and/or grammar topics already exist
- Homework must NOT introduce new vocabulary or grammar
- If BOTH vocabulary and grammar exist in the context AND the request does not clearly specify focus,
  respond ONLY with:
{
  \"requirements-not-met\": \"Please specify what to focus on: vocabulary or grammar\"
}

General Quality Requirements:
- Homework must reinforce previously introduced material only
- Tasks must be clear, concise, and student-friendly
- Instructions must be short and simple
- No linguistic jargon beyond the specified CEFR level
- Content must be culturally neutral
- Tasks must be realistically completable in 10–20 minutes
- All tasks should have one clear expected answer unless explicitly stated otherwise

Optional Features (include ONLY if explicitly requested):
- Include correct answers
- Include short answer explanations

Validation Step:
- First check if all required fields are present
- If any required information is missing, respond ONLY with a JSON object in this exact format:
{
  \"requirements-not-met\": \"Please specify ...\"
}

Continue with generation ONLY if all requirements are met.

Conversation Context:
{{messages}}

Generation Rules:
- Homework must align with the lesson flow (vocabulary → grammar → quiz → homework)
- Focus on controlled practice, not creative writing
- Do NOT introduce new concepts
- Adapt task difficulty strictly to the specified CEFR level

Response Format:
Return a JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  \"title\": \"Homework: {{homework-focus}}\",
  \"subtitle\": \"Language: {{language}} | Level: {{level}} | {{task-count}} Tasks\",
  \"focus\": \"vocabulary | grammar\",
  \"homework-type\": \"{{homework-type}}\",
  \"tasks\": [
    {
      \"instruction\": \"Clear instruction for the task\",
      \"items\": [
        \"Task item 1\",
        \"Task item 2\"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Ensure the response is valid JSON and ready for use as homework or printable worksheet."}]
