## support for material pdf/books

Vector Database + RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This is a must if your teacher assistant uses:
* PDF textbooks
* Student history
* Teacher’s course materials
* Grammar rules
* Personalized lesson plans
* Long-term student progress data

Workflow:

* Parse text documents into embeddings
* Store in vector DB:
  * Pinecone 
  * Weaviate 
  * Redis Vector Storage (best for your stack!)
  * PgVector (inside Postgres)

On each user message:
* Retrieve relevant paragraphs
* Inject them into LLM prompt
* LLM answers using course data

Pros
* Accurate 
* Can use teacher’s custom content 
* Highly configurable 
* Does not require “agents”

Cons
* Some engineering effort
* Requires embedding pipeline
* Larger context windows needed

## maybe even version 3. (because I need lot of data to train)

Fine-Tuned LLM (Custom Teaching Model)

If you want your assistant to sound:

* more pedagogical 
* more structured 
* more “teacher-like” 
* better at grading writing 
* better at explaining grammar

You can train a custom model using:

* OpenAI fine-tuning API 
* Llama models 
* Mixtral / Qwen fine-tunes 
* LoRA adapters

Pros 
* Highly specialized 
* Very consistent tone
* Accurate for grading
* Can outperform GPT-4 for narrow tasks
+ Cheaper per request after tuning

Cons
* Expensive (~$200–$2000)
* Requires high-quality dataset 
* Harder to maintain
